name: yj-arch-core
description: >-
  Repository architecture constitution for this monorepo. Use on every coding,
  review, or refactor task. Enforces fixed platform roots, unified env file
  names, universal entry/flow/domain/view/infra roles (domain = owned concept,
  persistence optional), acyclic imports, and minimal edit scope. Always apply
  together with exactly one matching yj-* platform skill for the folder being
  edited.

# yj-arch-core

## Purpose

Reduce AI cost and blast radius. Do not reinterpret the whole repo, add
wrappers/layers, or read unrelated platforms.

1. Existing repo conventions win when clearer than this skill.
2. Identify the platform root folder first, then load **only** that platform skill.
3. Edit the smallest file set that owns the change.

## Fixed platform roots

```text
backend/              # MSA + gRPC (yj-backend-msa)
backend-service/      # single BE (yj-backend-service)
frontend/             # yj-frontend
mobile-app/           # yj-mobile-app
pc-app/               # yj-pc-app
cli/                  # yj-cli
browser-extension/    # yj-browser-extension
scheduler/            # yj-scheduler
```

```text
{platform}/
  scripts/            # platform run + deploy entry points
  {service_name}/     # one deployable / one app
```

- `backend/proto/` is reserved (see yj-backend-msa).
- `browser-extension/native_{name}/` → **yj-backend-service**.
- Do not invent new platform roots or put app code at repo root.
- Do not create a `Makefile` inside any service folder, including generic `run`,
  `install`, or `help` targets. Do not add per-service `scripts/`.
  Root `make <platform>` starts all services under that platform (concurrent); `NAME=<service>` runs one.
  Platforms run via `*/scripts/run.*`; services are sibling dirs created with `yjcli service add`.
- The root `Makefile` / `make.bat` wires platform run and deploy commands. Use
  `<platform>-deploy-development|production [NAME=<service>]` for deploys.
  `deploy-common.*` owns shared build/package preparation; the environment-specific
  deploy script calls it and then owns upload/rollout. Generated deploy scripts fail
  with an implementation prompt until the repository replaces their guarded stubs.
- Deploy scripts are repository-owned after creation. `yjcli sync make` installs
  missing deploy scripts but preserves existing ones.
- `Diff.md` is an optional, user-maintained reference for meaningful architecture
  differences from yjcli defaults and their manual restoration notes. Update it
  when that record would help, but never treat it as an automated sync, migration,
  backup, comparison, or restoration mechanism. Never place secrets in it.


## Environment (guardrails only)

Required files at each service root (no plain `.env`):

`.env.local-dev` · `.env.examples`

- New services also start with `.env.development` and `.env.production`, but these
  are optional. Remove them when unused or add environments such as `.env.staging`,
  `.env.test`, or `.env.qa` as the project requires. Environment files must follow
  the `.env.<environment>` naming pattern; do not use plain `.env` or Vite's
  `.env.local` convention unless a thin loader maps it to this structure.
- Env field sets come from `templates/platform/envs/<kind>/` via platform mapping (`listen` / `worker` / `app`).
  - `listen`: `backend` (PORT 8080), `frontend` (PORT 5173)
  - `worker`: `backend-service`, `browser-extension/native_*`, `scheduler` (HOST/PORT optional)
  - `app`: `cli`, `mobile-app`, `pc-app`, `browser-extension` (NAME/VERSION only)
  Do not invent fields outside those templates; environment filenames remain
  extensible through the `.env.<environment>` pattern above.
- `HOST`/`PORT` are required for `listen`. For `worker` they are optional — add only if needed.
- `.env.examples` is the committed field contract. Format every entry as one
  comment line followed by one empty `FIELD=` line, with one blank line between
  entries.
- Every other `.env.<environment>` file lists populated `FIELD=value` lines
  consecutively, without field-description comments or separator blank lines.
- Commit `.env.examples` only; never commit `.env.local-dev` or any other
  environment value file.
- Local platform `run.*` uses `.env.local-dev` only — do not hardcode HOST/PORT in scripts.
- Each service declares its repository-owned local `RUN_COMMAND` in `.env.local-dev`.
  Platform `run.*` must execute that declaration and must not infer commands from
  `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, or other language/runtime manifests.

## Skill routing

| Path | Platform skill |
|------|----------------|
| `backend/**` | `yj-backend-msa` |
| `backend-service/**` | `yj-backend-service` |
| `frontend/**` | `yj-frontend` |
| `mobile-app/**` | `yj-mobile-app` |
| `pc-app/**` | `yj-pc-app` |
| `cli/**` | `yj-cli` |
| `browser-extension/native_*/**` | `yj-backend-service` |
| `browser-extension/**` (other) | `yj-browser-extension` |
| `scheduler/**` | `yj-scheduler` |

Never load all platform skills. Never apply a platform skill outside its folder.

## Universal roles

```text
entry   = executable entrypoint + route/command/screen registration + wiring
flow    = feature composition + dto / input-output shape
domain  = owned business concept (authority); persistence optional
view    = UI (only platforms that render UI)
infra   = shared technical modules (config, clients, logging, utils)
```

### Domain (owned concept — not “must have DB”)

Create `domains/{name}/` only when **this deployable owns** a concept (it is the authority for that idea).

Optional file slots inside a domain (use only what exists):

- `model` — data shape / entity (optional)
- `repository` — persistence/retrieval (optional; only if this process stores it)
- `rules` — decisions / pure policy (optional)
- `errors` / `types` — domain-only errors and value types (optional)

Valid shapes: data+rules · data only · rules only.  
If the deployable owns **no** concept → **omit `domains/` entirely**.

Missing domain does **not** mean collapse into entry. Still use flow + infra.

Placement when unsure:

1. Owned concept / shared policy across features? → domain  
2. One feature’s IO / mapping / orchestration? → flow (`services/{feature}`)  
3. Clients, config, logging, technical helpers? → infra (`modules`)  
4. Bootstrap / register only? → entry (`apps` or platform entry files)  
5. Otherwise do not invent a new home — extend an existing flow

UI clients default to **no `domain`**: model = API types; feature rules live in flow.  
Exception only for heavy client-owned offline DB/engine concepts.

## Import direction

Allowed: `entry -> flow -> domain -> infra`, `entry -> infra`, `flow -> infra`, `view -> flow`, `domain -> infra`.

Forbidden: `domain -> flow/entry/other domain`, `flow -> entry/other flow` (unless repo allows), `infra -> *`, `view -> domain/infra/network`, generated UI → project-specific imports.

Entry must stay thin: no feature DTOs, business policy, or grab-bag utils in entry packages.

Cycles are structure bugs — do not paper over with lazy imports or wrappers.

## Editing workflow

Before: platform skill → feature/domain → minimal file set → prefer reuse.

During: edit in place; no thin wrappers/adapters; no one-line functions unless the name is a real domain concept; keep feature work and drive-by refactors separate.

Avoid names: `{entity}_v2|_wrapper|_adapter|_helper`, `{feature}_manager|_processor`.

Avoid layers unless user requests: `usecases/`, `workflows/`, `orchestrations/`, `application/`, `controllers/`, `handlers/`.

`flow` is the composition layer — do not invent a layer above it.

After: summarize files, boundaries, new files, test/migration risk briefly.

## Cross-platform contracts

- Prefer generated clients / `backend/proto/dist/{lang}` over hand-copied DTOs.
- Do not import another platform's source tree.
- Do not read unrelated platforms unless the user task explicitly spans them.
