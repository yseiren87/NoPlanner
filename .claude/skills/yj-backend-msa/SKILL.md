name: yj-backend-msa
description: >-
  Backend MSA architecture with mandatory gRPC/protobuf. Language-agnostic
  (Go/Python/Java/etc.). Covers backend-msa/{service}; the contract is the
  shared root proto/ (yj-proto). Supports owner, policy, and edge/gateway
  services (domains optional). Use only when editing `backend-msa/**`.

# yj-backend-msa

Requires `yj-arch-core`. Scope: `backend-msa/**`.

## Shape

```text
backend-msa/
  {service_name}/
    apps/                  # entry
    services/              # flow
    domains/               # domain (optional — owned concepts only)
    modules/               # infra
```

- One `{service_name}` = one deployable microservice.
- Do not over-split domains into tiny services. Split by cohesive business capability.
- gRPC + protobuf are **mandatory**. External API surface is proto, not ad-hoc JSON structs copied across services.
- This platform has no proto folder of its own: the contract is the shared root `proto/` (see "Shared proto contract").

## Service stereotypes (same folders, different fill)

| Kind | `domains/` | Typical contents |
|------|------------|------------------|
| **Owner** | yes | model ± repository ± rules for concepts this service stores/decides |
| **Policy** | yes (rules-focused) | shared authz/quota/aggregation policy; often **no** repository |
| **Edge / BFF / gateway** | usually **omit** | `services/{feature}` + `modules` clients; add rules-only domain only if policy is shared across many features |

Omit empty `domains/` trees. Do not invent fake repositories to “have a domain”.

## proto

- Every service's API is defined in the root `proto/` (skill `yj-proto`); services depend on `proto/dist/<lang>/` by path.
- Prefer proto packages that align with service boundaries (`{domain}.v1` per owning service).
- Builds of this platform regenerate the contract first (see `yj-arch-core` › Tooling).
- Server-rendered HTML does not belong here: a service that must render pages lives in `backend-ssr/` (`yj-backend-ssr`) and calls MSA services over gRPC.

## Roles inside `{service_name}`

```text
entry  = apps/{app_name}/main.{ext}   # wiring / registration only
flow   = services/{feature}/dto.{ext} + service.{ext}
domain = domains/{domain}/…           # optional slots; see below
infra  = modules/{module}.{ext}
```

### entry

- Init, gRPC server registration, dependency wiring only.
- No business logic. No feature DTOs, policy, or utils dump under `apps/`.
- No direct domain calls (always through flow).

### flow

- Feature/workflow composition. DTOs for this service's use of contracts.
- Reuse services across RPCs; do not create a service per RPC automatically.
- Do not import other services' source trees; call them over gRPC using generated clients.
- Edge/gateway: put aggregation and feature-local mapping here — not in `apps/`.

### domain

Create only for **owned concepts** (this service is the authority). File slots are optional:

- `model.{ext}`: internal domain model, entity, schema, or data shape.
- `repository.{ext}`: persistence/retrieval — only if this process stores the concept.
- `rules.{ext}`: domain-specific decisions and pure validations.
- `errors.{ext}` / `types.{ext}`: domain errors and value types.

Rules:

- Valid: data+rules · data only · rules only. Repository is **not** required.
- No gRPC/transport types in domain.
- Domains must not import apps or services.
- No domain→domain imports; compose in flow.
- Do not duplicate the same responsibility across multiple domains.

### Relation domain

When two domains are both first-class concepts and their relationship is managed directly, create a relation domain.

Use when:

- `{domain_a}` and `{domain_b}` are both first-class concepts.
- Neither is merely a field of the other.
- The relationship itself is created, deleted, queried, or constrained.
- Multiple RPCs/routes express the same relationship from different perspectives.

```text
domains/{domain_a}/
domains/{domain_b}/
domains/{relation_domain}/
services/{relation_feature}/
  dto.{ext}
  service.{ext}
```

- The relation domain owns relationship mechanics only.
- It must not import the related domains directly.
- Existence checks, policy checks, and cross-domain composition belong in the service (flow).

### Edge / gateway placement

```text
apps/server/           # main + register only
services/{feature}/    # feature dto + orchestration
domains/{policy}/      # optional rules-only shared policy
modules/clients/       # downstream gRPC client factories
```

Forbidden in edge services: stuffing DTO/utils/policy into `apps/server/*` because “there is no domain”.

### infra

- config, db, logging, gRPC client factories, auth adapters, low-level helpers.
- No business logic or domain-specific helpers.
- Do not turn modules into a generic utilities dump.
- Modules must not import apps, services, or domains.

## Import direction

```text
entry -> flow -> domain -> infra
entry -> infra
flow  -> infra (including generated gRPC clients)
```

When `domains/` is omitted: `entry -> flow -> infra` (and `entry -> infra`).

Forbidden: handler→domain, domain→flow, cross-service source imports, new layers above flow, feature logic in entry.

## Editing scope

- Touch one `{service_name}` plus, if needed, the root `proto/` (and regenerate `proto/dist/`).
- Do not open `frontend/` or other platforms unless the user explicitly asks for a cross-change.

## Shared proto contract

- The gRPC/protobuf contract lives **only** at the repository root: schemas in `proto/*.proto`, generated libraries in `proto/dist/<lang>/` (skill `yj-proto`). It belongs to no platform.
- Before adding or calling a gRPC API, look for the root `proto/` and work there. Never create a `proto/` folder or a `.proto` file inside a platform or service folder, and never copy `.proto` files or generated code into one.
- If the repository has no root `proto/` (or not the language you need under `proto/dist/`), stop and ask the user to add it with yjcli (`yjcli proto add <language>`) instead of creating it by hand.
- Consume the generated library through a path dependency on `proto/dist/<lang>/`: Go `require` + `replace`, Dart `path:` dependency, Python editable path dependency. Do not edit generated code — change the `.proto` and regenerate (skill `yj-proto` › Generated libraries).
