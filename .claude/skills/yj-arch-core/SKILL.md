name: yj-arch-core
description: >-
  Repository architecture constitution for this monorepo. Use on every coding,
  review, or refactor task. Enforces fixed platform roots, the env field
  contract, universal entry/flow/domain/view/infra roles (domain = owned
  concept, persistence optional), acyclic imports, and minimal edit scope.
  Always apply together with exactly one matching yj-* platform skill for the
  folder being edited.

# yj-arch-core

## Purpose

Reduce AI cost and blast radius. Do not reinterpret the whole repo, add wrappers/layers, or read unrelated platforms.

1. Existing repo conventions win when clearer than this skill.
2. Identify the platform root folder first, then load **only** that platform skill.
3. Edit the smallest file set that owns the change.

## Platform roots

```text
backend-msa/          # yj-backend-msa
frontend/             # yj-frontend
```

```text
{platform}/
  {service_name}/     # one deployable / one app — code only
```

- Platform and service folders hold **code only**: source folders, stack files (e.g. `package.json`) and the service's `.env.examples`. Run/build/deploy tooling lives outside them (see Tooling below).
- `{platform}/proto/` is reserved for protobuf contracts; it is never a service.
- Do not invent new platform roots or put app code at repo root.
- Do not create a `Makefile`, `scripts/` folder or run/build script inside any platform or service folder.

## Environment contract

- Every service root has `.env.examples` — the committed field contract. Format every entry as one comment line followed by one empty `FIELD=` line, with one blank line between entries.
- Field sets come from the platform's env kind:
  - `listen`: `backend-msa` (PORT 8080), `frontend` (PORT 5173)
- `HOST`/`PORT` are required for `listen`. For `worker` they are optional — add them only when the process really listens. `app` services need NAME/VERSION only.
- Do not invent fields outside the contract; add a field to `.env.examples` first, then wherever its values are kept.
- Never commit a plain `.env`, and do not use Vite's `.env.local` convention unless a thin loader maps it to this structure.

## Tooling

### Secrets (`tools/secrets/`)

- Env values live only in `tools/secrets/<platform>/<service>/.env.<environment>`. Services keep `.env.examples` only — never create `.env*` value files inside a service folder.
- `.env.local-dev` is required. New services also start with `.env.development` and `.env.production`; remove unused ones or add others (`.env.staging`, `.env.test`, …) following the `.env.<environment>` naming pattern.
- These files are **committed in plain text** — the repository must stay private. Do not copy their values into code, docs, logs or commit messages.
- Value files list populated `FIELD=value` lines consecutively, without field-description comments or separator blank lines. Values are literal: no quotes, no `export`, no multi-line values (the `docker --env-file` format).
- When adding a field, add it to the service's `.env.examples` and to every `.env.<environment>` file of that service.

### Runner (`tools/runner/`)

- `make <platform> [NAME=<service>]` (`./make.ps1` on Windows) calls `tools/runner/<platform>/runner.sh` / `runner.ps1`.
- Follow `tools/runner/GUIDE.md` (managed by yjcli — do not edit). The scripts are repository-owned: the skeleton already handles service discovery, `.env.local-dev`, concurrency and Ctrl+C; implement only `run_one` / `Invoke-RunOne`, keeping `.sh` and `.ps1` equivalent.
- Local runs always use `.env.local-dev` — do not hardcode HOST/PORT in scripts.

### Builder (`tools/builder/`)

- `make <platform>-build-<env> [NAME=<service>]` (`./make.ps1` on Windows) calls `tools/builder/<platform>/builder.sh` / `builder.ps1` with `<env>` = `development` | `production`.
- Follow `tools/builder/GUIDE.md` (managed by yjcli — do not edit). Builds go to `dist/<platform>/<service>/` at the repository root, runnable on their own and without env value files. Implement only `build_one` / `Invoke-BuildOne` (and the proto function where present), keeping `.sh` and `.ps1` equivalent.

### Deployer (`tools/deployer/`)

- `make <platform>-deploy-<env> [NAME=<service>]` (`./make.ps1` on Windows) calls `tools/deployer/<platform>/deployer.sh` / `deployer.ps1`. It never builds.
- Follow `tools/deployer/GUIDE.md` (managed by yjcli — do not edit). Input is `dist/<platform>/<service>/` only; env values are injected at run time (`docker run --env-file tools/secrets/<platform>/<service>/.env.<env>`), never baked into an image. Dockerfiles live under `tools/deployer/<platform>/`. Implement only `deploy_one` / `Invoke-DeployOne`, keeping `.sh` and `.ps1` equivalent.

## Skill routing

| Path | Platform skill |
|------|------|
| `backend-msa/**` | `yj-backend-msa` |
| `frontend/**` | `yj-frontend` |

Never load all platform skills. Never apply a platform skill outside its folder.

## Universal roles

```text
entry   = executable entrypoint + route/command/screen registration + wiring
flow    = feature composition + dto / input-output shape
domain  = owned business concept (authority); persistence optional
view    = UI (only platforms that render UI)
infra   = shared technical modules (config, clients, logging, utils)
```

### Domain (owned concept — not “must have DB”)

Create `domains/{name}/` only when **this deployable owns** a concept (it is the authority for that idea).

Optional file slots inside a domain (use only what exists):

- `model` — data shape / entity (optional)
- `repository` — persistence/retrieval (optional; only if this process stores it)
- `rules` — decisions / pure policy (optional)
- `errors` / `types` — domain-only errors and value types (optional)

Valid shapes: data+rules · data only · rules only.  
If the deployable owns **no** concept → **omit `domains/` entirely**.

Missing domain does **not** mean collapse into entry. Still use flow + infra.

Placement when unsure:

1. Owned concept / shared policy across features? → domain  
2. One feature’s IO / mapping / orchestration? → the platform-defined flow boundary (commonly `services/{feature}`)
3. Clients, config, logging, technical helpers? → infra (`modules`)  
4. Bootstrap / register only? → entry (`apps` or platform entry files)  
5. Otherwise do not invent a new home — extend an existing flow

UI clients default to **no `domain`**: model = API types; feature rules live in flow.  
Exception only for heavy client-owned offline DB/engine concepts.

UI platform skills may map flow and view to separate technical roots. Those roots must use the same feature boundary so one feature's flow and view remain easy to locate without mixing their roles.

## Import direction

Allowed: `entry -> flow -> domain -> infra`, `entry -> infra`, `flow -> infra`, `view -> flow`, `domain -> infra`.

Forbidden: `domain -> flow/entry/other domain`, `flow -> entry/other flow` (unless repo allows), `infra -> *`, `view -> domain/infra/network`, generated UI → project-specific imports.

Entry must stay thin: no feature DTOs, business policy, or grab-bag utils in entry packages.

Cycles are structure bugs — do not paper over with lazy imports or wrappers.

## Editing workflow

Before: platform skill → feature/domain → minimal file set → prefer reuse.

During: edit in place; no thin wrappers/adapters; no one-line functions unless the name is a real domain concept; keep feature work and drive-by refactors separate.

Avoid names: `{entity}_v2|_wrapper|_adapter|_helper`, `{feature}_manager|_processor`.

Avoid layers unless user requests: `usecases/`, `workflows/`, `orchestrations/`, `application/`, `controllers/`, `handlers/`.

`flow` is the composition layer — do not invent a layer above it.

After: summarize files, boundaries, new files, test/migration risk briefly.

## Cross-platform contracts

- Prefer generated clients / `{platform}/proto/dist/{lang}` (e.g. `backend-msa/proto/dist/{lang}`) over hand-copied DTOs.
- Do not import another platform's source tree.
- Do not read unrelated platforms unless the user task explicitly spans them.
