# and the env file exist, warning on a BUILD_INFO environment mismatch - already works.
# The deployer never builds: run `make.ps1 frontend-build-<env>` first.
# This is the entry point `make.ps1 frontend-deploy-<env>` calls. It does not
# have to stay a single file: add helper scripts next to it and call them from here.
