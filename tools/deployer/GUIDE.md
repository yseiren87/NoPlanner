# Deployer guide

> Managed by yjcli — regenerated on every run. Do not edit; put project notes in `AGENTS.md`. The scripts under `tools/deployer/<platform>/` are yours.

The deployer ships what the builder put in `dist/`. It never builds.

## Entry points

| Command | Script |
|---|---|
| `make <platform>-deploy-<env>` / `./make.ps1 <platform>-deploy-<env>` | `tools/deployer/<platform>/deployer.sh <env>` / `deployer.ps1 <env>` |
| `… NAME=<service>` | same script, with `<service>` as the second argument |

`<env>` is `development` or `production`. Build first with `make <platform>-build-<env>`. Current services:

- `backend-msa/`: `document`, `evaluation`, `gateway`, `generation`, `intelligence`, `project`, `research`, `user`
- `frontend/`: `app`

## What is already implemented

Each `deployer.sh` / `deployer.ps1` ships a working skeleton:

- Checks `<env>` and the optional service; deploys every service when omitted.
- Before deploying anything, checks that every service has a complete build (`dist/<platform>/<service>/BUILD_INFO`) and `tools/secrets/<platform>/<service>/.env.<env>`; otherwise it fails and tells you which build to run.
- Warns when `BUILD_INFO` says the build was made for another environment.
- Runs your deploy function inside `dist/<platform>/<service>/`, stopping at the first failure with a non-zero exit code.

## What you implement

- `deployer.sh`: `deploy_one <service>` · `deployer.ps1`: `Invoke-DeployOne <service>` — deploy one service from `$IN` / `$In`.
- Available: the environment, the build folder, the env file path (`$ENV_FILE` / `$EnvFile`) and the script folder (`$SCRIPT_DIR` / `$ScriptDir`).

Until implemented they print a pointer to this guide and fail.

## Requirements

- Input is `dist/<platform>/<service>/` only. Do not rebuild from source here.
- Env values come from `tools/secrets/<platform>/<service>/.env.<env>` at **run time**, so one build works in any environment.
- `deployer.sh` and `deployer.ps1` behave the same.

### Docker

When a service is shipped as a container:

- The image only copies the build: `docker build -f <Dockerfile> dist/<platform>/<service>` with `COPY . /app` — no compiling inside the image beyond what the runtime needs.
- Never copy `.env.*` into the image and never pass env values as `--build-arg`.
- Inject them when the container starts: `docker run --env-file tools/secrets/<platform>/<service>/.env.<env> …` (or `env_file:` in compose / the orchestrator's equivalent).
- `--env-file` reads plain `KEY=VALUE` lines: no quotes, no `export`, no multi-line values. Keep the secrets files in that format.
- Keep Dockerfiles under `tools/deployer/<platform>/` (e.g. `Dockerfile`, or `<service>.Dockerfile` when services differ) — service folders hold code only.

Other targets (static hosting, scp, app stores, …) follow the same rule: the input is `dist/`, env values are supplied by the target at run time.

## More than one script

yjcli ships one entry script per platform. That is a starting point, not a limit: when a platform needs more (Dockerfiles, per-service deploy scripts, rollout and health-check helpers), add files under `tools/deployer/<platform>/` or `tools/deployer/` and call them from the entry script instead of growing one file indefinitely. Keep the entry script name — `make` calls it.
