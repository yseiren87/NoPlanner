# Builder guide

> Managed by yjcli — regenerated on every run. Do not edit; put project notes in `AGENTS.md`. The scripts under `tools/builder/<platform>/` are yours.

The builder turns each service into a runnable build under `dist/`. It only builds — deploying is the deployer's job.

## Entry points

| Command | Script |
|---|---|
| `make <platform>-build-<env>` / `./make.ps1 <platform>-build-<env>` | `tools/builder/<platform>/builder.sh <env>` / `builder.ps1 <env>` |
| `… NAME=<service>` | same script, with `<service>` as the second argument |

`<env>` is `development` or `production`. Current services:

- `backend-msa/`: `document`, `evaluation`, `gateway`, `generation`, `intelligence`, `project`, `research`, `user`
- `frontend/`: `app`

## Output contract

- Every service builds into **`dist/<platform>/<service>/`** at the repository root (never inside the service folder).
- That folder alone must be runnable: the deployer copies it as-is.
- It must not contain env value files (`.env.*`). Env values are supplied when the build runs, not when it is built.
- `dist/<platform>/<service>/BUILD_INFO` records `platform`, `service`, `environment`, `version`, `built_at`. It is written only after a successful build and marks the folder as complete; a failed build leaves no output.
- `dist/` is git-ignored.

## What is already implemented

Each `builder.sh` / `builder.ps1` ships a working skeleton:

- Checks `<env>` and the optional service; builds every service when omitted.
- Empties `dist/<platform>/<service>/` before each build.
- Runs your build function inside `<platform>/<service>/`, then writes `BUILD_INFO`. Version: the service's `package.json` / `pyproject.toml` `version`, else the `VERSION` env var, else `unknown`.
- Stops at the first failing service with a non-zero exit code.
- On platforms that need the shared proto contract (`backend-msa`), runs `tools/builder/proto/builder.sh` once before the services.

## What you implement

- `builder.sh`: `build_one <service>` · `builder.ps1`: `Invoke-BuildOne <service>` — build one service into `$OUT` / `$Out`.
- Available: the environment, the output folder, and the path of `tools/secrets/<platform>/<service>/.env.<env>` (`$ENV_FILE` / `$EnvFile`). Read it only for values that must be fixed at build time (e.g. a frontend bundle); never copy it into the output.

Until implemented they print a pointer to this guide and fail.

## Proto contract

The shared gRPC/protobuf contract lives at the repository root in `proto/` (schemas `proto/*.proto`); there is no proto folder inside any platform. Languages generated now: `go`.

| Command | Script |
|---|---|
| `make proto-build` / `./make.ps1 proto-build` | `tools/builder/proto/builder.sh` / `builder.ps1` — every language under `proto/dist/` |
| `… PROTO_LANG=<language>` | same script, one language |

- Implement one function per language: `gen_<language>` (`builder.sh`) / `Invoke-Gen<Language>` (`builder.ps1`). The skeleton finds the languages, skips the run when there is no `.proto` yet, and fails with a pointer here when a function is missing (add one when you add a language later).
- Output goes to `proto/dist/<language>/` — a library package, not a deployable build (`dist/` at the root is unrelated). Each folder already has its manifest: Go `go.mod` (module `noplanner/proto`), Dart `pubspec.yaml` (`noplanner_proto`, code in `lib/`), Python `pyproject.toml` (`noplanner-proto`, package `noplanner_proto/`). Keep the manifest; regenerate only the code, and remove code of deleted `.proto` files.
- Keep only what a consumer needs: generated code plus the manifest (Go also `go.sum` after `go mod tidy`). No lock files (`pubspec.lock`, `uv.lock`) — consumers own those.
- Consumers use a path dependency on `proto/dist/<language>/` (Go `replace`, Dart `path:`, Python editable path), never a copy of the `.proto` files.
- protoc is the standard (buf is not used). Generated code is committed so consumers and CI build without protoc.

## Requirements

- Build for where the service will run. If the deploy target is a Linux container, produce something that runs there (e.g. `GOOS=linux` for Go, or dependencies installed for Linux).
- `builder.sh` and `builder.ps1` produce the same output.
- `builder.sh` must work on macOS's bash 3.2.

## More than one script

yjcli ships one entry script per platform. That is a starting point, not a limit: when a platform needs more (per-language build steps, per-service scripts, a shared helper), add files under `tools/builder/<platform>/` or `tools/builder/` and call them from the entry script instead of growing one file indefinitely. Keep the entry script name — `make` calls it.
